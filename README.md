## Flutter DDD  

A fun project with a simple implementation of DDD using MobX and Modular, leveraging the public Binance API to fetch currency prices.

UI: Developing a polished interface is not the priority. **The main goal is to implement and test programming best practices, with a strong focus on architecture.**

### Why MobX + Modular?  

This combination might not be as popular as Bloc, nor is it the newest stack for State Management.  

However, it strikes a great balance between simplicity and the powerful tools that state management can offer.

It sits between the verbosity of Bloc and the minimalism of ValueNotifier/ChangeNotifier.  

Most importantly, it works. Really well. ðŸš€

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

This project applies **DDD concepts** to separate application layers:

- `domain/` contains core business logic: entities, services, and use cases  
- `data/` handles external data sources (API, DB), using models and repositories  
- `presentation/` contains UI and controllers  
- `core/` and `shared/` include reusable and app-wide concerns (e.g., http, exceptions, constants)
